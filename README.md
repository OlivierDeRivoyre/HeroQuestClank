# Overview
This is a card game that can be printed.

The game is designed to be played on a board, typically using games like HeroQuest or Descent as support. Instead of traditional dices, the rules are modified to be played with cards (and basic D6 dices). 

The player have a deck of cards. Each turn, the player can buy some new card to improve is deck.

# The board game rules are:
 - Players start with the 11 basic cards.
 - The game master fills the shop with cards that players can buy for energy (represented by stars) at the end of their turn when they have fought. There should be 2 available common cards and 4 random cards.
 - Each player draws 5 cards.
 - Players can choose the order in which they play.

# Player Turn Sequence:
 - During a player's turn:
 -- The player rolls 2 dice: one for movement and one for attack.
 -- The player can play any number of cards to add dices or for other effects.
 -- The player chooses which dice are for movement and which are for attack.
 -- The player moves their character. Diagonal movement is not allowed, but they can move through other players.
 -- If adjacent (including diagonally), the player can deal damage to enemies.
 -- After attacking, the player can purchase cards from the shop. To do so, the player must have played cards that provide energy. A purchased card goes to the player’s discard pile.
 -- At the end of the turn, the player draws cards to have 5 in hand. If there are no more cards to draw, the player shuffles their discarded cards to form a new draw deck.
 - Once all players have completed their turns, the game master plays the monsters.

# Monster Attack Mechanics:
 - Monster moves and attacks.
 - A monster's attack power increases every 2 turns. Once a monster appears, it deals 1 damage on the first turn, 1 damage on the second turn, 2 damage on the third and fourth turns, and 3 damage on the fifth and sixth turns, and so on.
 - Each player has 3 life points. Players can negate monster damage using shields.
 - If a player’s life points reach 0, they are KO and cannot play until the end of the fight.
 - If all players are KO, the game is lost.
 - At the end of a fight, once there are no more monsters, a KO player can be healed by another player. In this case, the KO player must give a card from their hand to their savior.
 - At the end of a fight, all players restore their life to 3 points.

# Monster Abilities:
 - Shield: Damage from players is reduced for monsters with shields. Unlike players, shields never exhaust.
 - Stone Heart: A player must deal a certain amount of damage to destroy each stone heart. For example, a monster with 3 stone hearts and 10 armor requires 3 hits of 10+ damage to be defeated.
 - Ranged Attack: The monster does not need to be adjacent to hit a player.
 - Circular Attack: The monster hits all players in the 8 cells surrounding it.
